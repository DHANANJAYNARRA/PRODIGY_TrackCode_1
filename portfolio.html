                    <p>Password is a secrete that is used for authentication. Graphical password authentication system is an authentication system that uses some combination of graphical images replacing the regular passwords .Therefore graphical passwords
                        offer better security than text and other forms of passwords which indeed protects from different types of cyber attacks.<br><br> The advantages of using this kind of authentication interface is that it provides a way of making
                        more human friendly passwords and this a kind of recognition-recall technique used for this the user need not to remember the password they can just recall the images and the authentication is done</p>

                    <p>Blockchain technology which does not require any third party and verification will be done by software algorithm itself without involvement of any third party.In this to avoid forge counterfeit we are converting all productsdetails/barcode
                        into digital signatures and this digital signatures will be stored in Blockchain server as this Blockchain server support tamper proof data storage and nobody can hack or alter its data and if by an chance if its data alter then
                        verification get failed at next block storage and user may get intimation about data alter.<br> <br> In Blockchain each data will be stored by verifying old hash codes and if old hash codes remain unchanged then data will be consider
                        as original and unchanged and then new transaction data will be appended to Blockchain as new block. For each new data storage all blocks hash code will be verified.</p><br>

                <h3>UDP SOCKET INTERFACE FOR 3D PLOTTING:</h3>
                <p>The main aim of the project is to develop real time interface for 3D plotting of an aerospace vehicle using UDP- socket.. First part of our project is to study socket program operating system and QT programming on linux environment. UDP
                    socket routines enable simple IP communication using the User Datagram protocol (UDP). The UDP runs on the top of the IP and was device for application that do not require reliability, acknowlegdment or flow control features at the
                    transport layer.<br> <br> Hardware-in-loop (HIL)simulation is a technique that is used in the development and testing of complex real-time embedded systems. HIL simulation provides an effective testing platform by adding the complexity
                    of the process-actuator system, known as a plant, to the test platform. The complexity of the plant under control is included in testing and development by adding a mathematical representation of all related dynamic systems. These
                    mathematical representations are referred to as the "plant simulation".</p> <br>
